## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up this UI, you may want to have an Agno agent backend running. If you haven't set up the Agno Playground yet, follow the [official guide](https://docs.agno.com/get-started/playground#running-playground-locally) to run the Playground locally.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-ui.git
cd agent-ui
```

<Tip>Make sure you have Node.js and pnpm installed on your system before proceeding.</Tip>

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Connecting to an Agent Backend

By default, Agent UI connects to `http://localhost:7777`, which works with the standard Agno Playground setup.
</Note>

You can change the endpoint by:
1. Hovering over the endpoint URL in the UI
2. Clicking the edit option
3. Entering your new endpoint URL



The default endpoint works with the standard Agno Playground setup described in the [official documentation](https://docs.agno.com/get-started/playground#running-playground-locally).
